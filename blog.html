      <p>So I had this ding in my board‚Äîclassic pressure crack from trying to ollie a wave (don't ask)‚Äîand I figured, why not ask an LLM for repair advice? I mean, we're all using AI for everything else, right?</p>
      <p>The response was... technically correct. "Apply marine epoxy resin to the affected area, ensuring proper ventilation and a 2:1 hardener ratio." Great! Except I live in a beach shack where "proper ventilation" means "hoping the wind is blowing the right direction."</p>

        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> AI is incredible at aggregating knowledge that already exists. But it can't tell you that your "workspace" is literally sand and that seagulls WILL try to steal your mixing cup.

      <p>This got me thinking about how we deploy AI for clients. Everyone wants the chatbot. Nobody wants to admit their "knowledge base" is seven PDFs from 2014 and a Slack channel called #random-stuff.</p>

      <p>Had a call yesterday with a founder who wanted "an AI strategy." I asked what problems they were trying to solve. They said "we need to be AI-first because investors are asking."</p>
      <p>Cool. Cool cool cool. Let me save you $50K in consulting fees: <strong>you don't need an AI strategy. You need A STRATEGY that might include AI.</strong></p>
      <p>Here's the test: Can you describe your problem without using the words "leverage," "synergy," or "paradigm"? If no, your problem isn't actually a problem‚Äîit's a vibes check for your next board meeting.</p>

      <p>Everyone talks about "agentic AI"‚Äîthese autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and execute tasks. But nobody talks about the OG agentic system: coastal seagulls.</p>
      <p>Think about it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal-oriented:</strong> Acquire sandwich by any means necessary</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Adjusts strategy based on human resistance levels</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Coordinates with other seagulls in real-time</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent:</strong> Will retry failed approaches indefinitely</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I spent three weeks observing the local seagull colony and logging their behavior patterns. Trained a simple decision tree model. Accuracy? 89% at predicting which human would get dive-bombed next.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Practical Application:</strong> This same model now powers our "Agentic Seagull" product for task orchestration. It's literally just reinforcement learning with french fries as the reward signal.

      <p>Quick quiz: What's the difference between our "LLM on a Stick" and "LLM on a Stick (for Enterprise)"?</p>
      <p>If you answered "literally nothing except the price," congratulations‚Äîyou understand enterprise software better than most VCs.</p>
      <p>Here's what actually happens when someone asks for "enterprise" features:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I add the word "Enterprise" to the product name</li>
        <li>I create a 40-slide deck instead of 20</li>
        <li>I wear shoes to the demo</li>
        <li>I speak 30% slower and nod more solemnly</li>
        <li>Price goes up 10x</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The dirty secret? Enterprise clients don't want better software. They want <em>the confidence to explain to their boss why they spent $500K</em>. The ROI calculation IS the product.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Change my mind: "Prompt engineering" is just rediscovering everything technical writers figured out in the 1990s, but with more JSON and fewer comprehensible documentation standards.</p>
      <p>Everyone's out here sharing "prompt hacks" like they discovered fire. Meanwhile, every principle is just:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be specific (technical writing 101)</li>
        <li>Provide examples (literally how humans learn)</li>
        <li>Structure your request clearly (again, technical writing)</li>
        <li>Iterate based on feedback (QA, but make it ‚ú®AI‚ú®)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're charging $300/hour for "prompt optimization" when the actual skill is "being able to explain what you want without assuming the listener can read your mind."</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Controversial Opinion:</strong> If you can't explain your task to a junior dev, an LLM won't magically understand it either. The model isn't the problem‚Äîyour requirements gathering is.

      <p>I once had a potential client ask about our "compliance framework." I gestured to the palm tree outside my shack and said "there's our Chief Compliance Officer."</p>
      <p>They laughed. Then they saw I was serious. Then they asked about our incident response plan. I showed them my phone number written on a piece of driftwood.</p>
      <p>Here's the thing: half of "AI governance" is security theater designed to make executives feel better about decisions they don't understand. The other half is genuinely important stuff like data privacy and bias testing.</p>
      <p>How do you tell which is which? <strong>Ask if removing it would actually increase risk.</strong> If the answer is "no, but the auditor expects it," congratulations‚Äîyou found the theater.</p>
